    "\n",
    "**IPython** (L) has abstracted and extended the notion of a traditional Read-Evaluate-Print Loop (REPL) environment by _**decoupling**_ the evaluation into its own process. We call this process a **kernel** (E): it receives execution instructions from **clients** (RP) and communicates the results back to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This decoupling allows us to have **_several clients connected to the same kernel_**, and even allows _**clients and kernels to live on different machines**_. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the exclusion of the traditional single process terminal-based IPython (what you start if you run ipython without any subcommands), all other IPython machinery uses this two-process model. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Most of this is now part of the **Jupyter project**, which includes \n",
    "\n",
    "* jupyter console, \n",
    "* jupyter qtconsole, and \n",
    "* jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, this means that when you start jupyter qtconsole, youâ€™re really starting two processes, \n",
    "\n",
    "* a kernel\n",
    "* a Qt-based client \n",
    "\n",
    "The latter can send commands to and receive results from that kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there is **already a kernel running** that you want to connect to, you can pass the --existing flag which will skip initiating a new kernel and connect to the most recent kernel, instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "To connect to a specific kernel once you have several kernels running, use the %**connect_info** magic to get the unique connection file, which will be something like --existing kernel-19732.json but with different numbers which correspond to the Process ID of the kernel."

    "The traditional IPython (ipython) consists of a single process that combines a terminal based UI with the process that runs the users code.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this traditional application still exists, the modern IPython consists of two processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Kernel: this is the process that runs the users code.\n",
    "* Frontend: this is the process that provides the user interface where the user types code and sees results.\n",

    "* Qt Console (ipython qtconsole)\n",
    "* Notebook (ipython notebook)\n",

This opens the door for all sorts of interesting things, such as connecting a Console or Qt Console to a Notebook's Kernel. For example, you may want to connect a Qt console to your Notebook's Kernel and use it as a help browser, calling ?? on objects in the Qt console (whose pager is more flexible than the one in the notebook).\n",
